# useLocalStorageState

The `useLocalStorageState` hook is a custom React hook that provides a simple way to sync a state variable with localStorage. 
It allows you to persist data across browser sessions and manage state just like a regular useState hook, but with the added 
benefit of storage persistence.

## Type
```typescript
    useLocalStorageState<T>(key: string, defaultValue?: T) => [T, (value: T) => void]
```
#### Parameters:
- `key: string`: The key under which the value will be stored in localStorage.
- `defaultValue?: T`: An optional default value that will be set if no value exists in localStorage.
#### Return Value:
`[state, setState]`: A tuple where:
- `state`: The current value of the state, retrieved from localStorage or set to the default value.
- `setState`: A function to update the state and localStorage.
## Usage
This hook is useful for managing persistent application state, such as user preferences, form data, or theme settings, across page reloads.
```javascript
    
    const [language, setLanguage] = useLocalStorageState("language");
```
