# usePrevious

The `usePrevious` hook is a custom React hook that allows you to track the previous value of a state or prop across renders.
It helps in scenarios where you need to compare the current value with its previous value, such as handling transitions, animations,
or conditionally triggering actions based on changes.

## Type
```typescript
    usePrevious<T>(value: T) => T|undefined
```
#### Parameters:
- `value: T`: The current value (state or prop) that you want to track.

#### Return Value:

- `T | undefined`: The previous value of the provided value, or undefined if it's the first render.
## Usage
This hook is useful when you need to access the previous state or prop value to compare it with the current one or make decisions based on changes.


```javascript
const [stage,setStage] = useState<'todo'|'in progress'|'pending'|'canceled'>('todo');

const previousStage = usePrevious(stage);
```
