# useWorker

The `useWorker` hook is a custom React hook that simplifies the process of utilizing Web Workers to offload expensive computations to a separate thread.
 This helps improve application performance by preventing blocking of the main UI thread. The hook creates a worker from a provided function and 
  offers a clean API to interact with it, including sending messages and terminating the worker.


## Type
```typescript
useWorker<T>(fn: (...arg) => T): UseWorkerReturnProps<T> 

type UseWorkerReturnProps<T> = {
  status: STATUS;
  terminate: () => void;
  workerHandler: (arg?: any) => Promise<T>;
}

enum STATUS {
  LOADING = 'loading',
  IDLE = 'idle',
}

```
#### Parameters:
- `fn: (arg?: any) => any`: The function to be executed in the Web Worker, it must be a non-void function.

#### Return Value:

`UseWorkerReturnProps<T>`: An object containing the following properties:
- `status: STATUS`: Indicates the current status of the worker ('idle' or 'loading').
- `terminate: () => void`: A function to terminate the worker.
- `workerHandler: (arg?: any) => Promise<T>`: A function works on behalf of the `fn` function that accepts parameters of the `fn` function. 
The role is to send data to the worker and receive the computed result as a promise.

## Usage
This hook is ideal for scenarios where heavy computations need to be performed without blocking the UI, such as processing large datasets or 
performing complex calculations.

```javascript
const countFromZeroTo = (limit) => {
  let count = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < limit; i++) {
    count += 1;
  }
  return count;
};

const Component = () => {
    const { status, workerHandler } = useWorker<number>(countFromZeroTo);
    const startHeavyTask = async () => {
        const result = await workerHandler(20000000);
    };
    ...
};

```
## Limitations
- The worker function cannot import external modules or dependencies. 
If additional logic or libraries are required, they must be explicitly included in the serialized function.
```javascript
function workerFunction() {
  const helper = () => console.log("Helper function");
  helper();
}

```
